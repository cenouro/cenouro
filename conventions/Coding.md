# Coding conventions

Although the Internet is full of conventions and guidelines, I have also
"developed" some personal conventions over time. This file describes generic
conventions and has some interesting references.

As always, take things with a grain of salt. These conventions work for me;
they won't necessarily work for you.

### Coplien articles and related stuff

Coplien has written two articles about TDD. Here are links to both, as well as links to some replies.

### Monte Carlo reliability techniques

I first started searching for references about Monte Carlo techniques after reading Coplien's articles.
It is really hard to thing articles about this subject applied to software. It seems much more
to be closely related to hardware. Still, I was able to find the following article. Although seeming
a bit of hardcore and going through great lengths in order to illustrate the concept, it is very useful.
